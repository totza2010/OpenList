	// 512 MiB is what the server itself picks when preferredPartSize is omitted,
	// and what the reference rclone backend defaults to. Note that OpenList
	// buffers each in-flight part, so the working set is roughly

	UploadConcurrency int64 `json:"upload_concurrency" type:"number" default:"4" help:"Number of parts uploaded in parallel (max 16). Each one is buffered, so this multiplies chunk size."`

	// The server hashes every part regardless; this only controls whether we
	// also hash locally and make the server compare, catching corruption in
	// transit. Named after the reference rclone backend's option.
	HashEnabled bool `json:"hash_enabled" type:"bool" default:"true" help:"Send a BLAKE3 checksum with each part so the server verifies it. Costs one extra read of each part."`
